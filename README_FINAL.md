# 🧬 AI-Driven Drug Discovery Platform - READY TO GO!

## 🎯 What You Have

A complete drug discovery platform that connects your Google Colab ML pipeline with a beautiful React frontend. Users can enter any disease name and get AI-predicted drug candidates with bioactivity, toxicity, and synergy scores.

## 🚀 Quick Start (3 Steps)

### 1. Start React Frontend
```bash
# Windows
quick_start.bat

# Mac/Linux
./quick_start.sh

# Or manually
npm run dev
```
**→ Open http://localhost:5173/**

### 2. Start Google Colab Backend
1. Go to https://colab.research.google.com/
2. Upload `Google_Colab_Flask_API.ipynb`
3. Run all cells
4. Copy the ngrok URL (e.g., `https://abc123.ngrok.io`)

### 3. Connect Them
```bash
python update_api_config.py
# Enter your ngrok URL when prompted
```

**→ Done! Your platform is ready!**

## 🎨 What Users See

1. **Beautiful Homepage** with disease input form
2. **Real-time API Status** (green = connected, red = disconnected)
3. **Interactive Results Table** with:
   - Sortable columns
   - Expandable rows for details
   - Color-coded scores
   - Summary statistics
4. **One-Click CSV Download** for results

## 🔧 For Your ML Pipeline

Replace the mock function in Colab with your actual code:

```python
def run_drug_discovery_pipeline(disease_name):
    # Your OpenTargets API calls
    # Your ChEMBL API calls  
    # Your ML models
    # Return drugs array with required fields
```

## 📊 Data Format Expected

Your ML pipeline should return:
```json
[
  {
    "drug_id": "CHEMBL1234",
    "name": "Drug Name",
    "predicted_activity": "Active/Inactive",
    "predicted_toxicity": 0.12,
    "synergy_score": 0.85,
    "mechanism": "Mechanism of action",
    "target": "Target protein",
    "phase": "Clinical phase",
    "activity_confidence": 0.92,
    "toxicity_confidence": 0.88,
    "overall_score": 0.89
  }
]
```

## 🎯 Perfect for Hackathon

✅ **Professional UI** - Modern, responsive design  
✅ **Real-time ML** - Live predictions from your models  
✅ **Interactive Results** - Sort, expand, download  
✅ **Error Handling** - Graceful error messages  
✅ **API Monitoring** - Shows connection status  
✅ **CSV Export** - Download results instantly  

## 🏆 Demo Script

1. "This is our AI-driven drug discovery platform"
2. "Enter any disease name to predict drug candidates"
3. "Our ML models analyze bioactivity, toxicity, and synergy"
4. "Results are displayed in an interactive table"
5. "You can download the results as CSV"

## 📁 Files You Need

- `Google_Colab_Flask_API.ipynb` - Your Colab backend
- `src/` - React frontend (already configured)
- `COMPLETE_SETUP_GUIDE.md` - Detailed instructions
- `quick_start.bat/sh` - One-click startup

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

**API Disconnected?**
- Check ngrok is running in Colab
- Verify URL in `src/api.js`

**No Results?**
- Check Colab output for errors
- Test with simple disease names

**Download Issues?**
- Check browser console (F12)
- Verify `/download_csv` endpoint

## 🎉 You're Ready!

Your drug discovery platform is **100% ready** for your hackathon demo. Just replace the mock ML pipeline with your actual code, and you'll have a professional platform that will impress the judges!

**Good luck! 🧬💊🏆**
